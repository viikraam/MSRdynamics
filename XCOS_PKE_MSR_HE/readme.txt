params.sci file contains structures with the time, reactivity, and source vectors. The file needs to be executed in Scilab to load the variables into the workspace for the model to use. 

The PKE_MSR.xcos file is a model of the MSR PKE equations with transit delay terms. The constant terms are defined by running the params.sci file. 

Plots are made by running the plotting.sci file.
