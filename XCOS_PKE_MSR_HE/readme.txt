params.sci file contains all the parameters needed to run the model. The calculations are done in the file and some parameters may vary slightly from the ones given in ORNL-67-102. The file needs to be executed in Scilab to load the variables into the workspace for the model to use. 


Plots are made by running the plotting.sci file. 


The PKE_MSR_HE.xcos file is the complete working model from ORNL-67-102 of the two-fluid thorium-based Molten Salt Breeder Reactor. The model and its parameters need to be refined for more precision, but the model is accurate to first order.
